        <h1>My Recipies</h1>
        <p>“We eat first with our eyes.” Or so goes the old saying, which refers to how food looks on the plate. In a
            restaurant, though, this takes on a new meaning, because even how a menu is written determines how we’ll
            approach our order. Think about it: fonts, colors, amount of space between each item, whether or not prices
            are printed, at what point the menu appears in the meal (some don't show up until afterwards!), how flowery
            the language is... There are as many menu-writing styles as there are schools of cooking.
